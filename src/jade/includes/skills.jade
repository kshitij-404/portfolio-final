                'I write code that conforms to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>\'s web standards and semantic best practices. I use technologies like <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr> / Jade, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS3</abbr> (<abbr title="Sassy CSS">SCSS</abbr>) and jQuery, to transform static artwork into mobile first, pixel prefect, interactive and fully functional interfaces; exactly the way your designers intend them to be.'

                'WordPress has become the simplest and quickest way for me to develop new, fully content managed websites. Sell your products online or set up a blog, either way, you\'ll have the ability to manage your content just the way you want to with only the parts you really need and nothing in your way.'

                'How will we ensure your website looks great on multiple devices; including those that haven\'t even been invented yet? I build using a responsive grid system mobile first. Experience with frontend frameworks such as <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/" target="_blank">Bourbon Neat</a> ensure that layouts are now quicker, smarter, standardised and more future-proof.'
