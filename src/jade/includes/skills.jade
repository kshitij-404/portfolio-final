                'I write code that conforms to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>\'s web standards and semantic best&ndash;practices. I use technologies like <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr> / Jade, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS3</abbr> (<abbr title="Sassy CSS">SCSS</abbr>) and jQuery, to transform static artwork into pixel-prefect, interactive and fully functional interfaces; exactly the way your designers intend them to be.'
